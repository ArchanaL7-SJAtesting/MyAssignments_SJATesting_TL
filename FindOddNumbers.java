	/*I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. Let's clarify the division of \( 1 \) by \( 2 \) in terms of its quotient and remainder:

### Division of 1 by 2:

- When you perform the division \( 1 \div 2 \), the result is \( 0.5 \).

### Integer Division:

- In integer arithmetic, when dividing \( 1 \) by \( 2 \):
  - The quotient is \( 0 \) (the whole number part of \( 0.5 \)).
  - The remainder is \( 1 \).

### Modulus Operation:

- In programming, the modulus operator (`%`) gives the remainder of a division operation.
- For `1 % 2` in programming:

  - \( 1 \mod 2 = 1 \)

### Conclusion:

- \( 1 \div 2 = 0 \) with a remainder of \( 1 \).
- Therefore, `1 % 2` equals \( 1 \), not \( 0 \).

I apologize for any confusion caused earlier. If you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss, please feel free to ask!*/
